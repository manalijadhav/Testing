Types of Testing:
------------------
1.Testing Related to change
	1.Retesting /Confirmation Testing
	What : Re-execution of Failed Test Case
	When : After defect found and Fixed by developer
	Why(Objective)  : To confirm defect has been fixed or not ?
	
	2.Regression Testing		
	What : CHecking impact/effect of Change Part/portion on Unchange 	Part/portion.
	When : After Any Change
		1.Defect fixing
		2.Add New Requirement
		3.Delete/Modify requirement
		4.Environment Change
	
	Why(Objective) : To Make Sure Changes do not introduce 
			new Defect


	Impact Analysis:
	----------------
	A process in which identification of number of dependant
	Pass TC to Fail TC  happens using RTM
	
	Requirement Traceability Matrix/ Bi -Directional Traceability 	Matrix
	-------------------------------------------------------------
	>A Table having Mapping between Requirement & Test Case
	>Very usefull to get requirment Coverage is 100 % or not
	>Used in Regression Testing to calculate number of Test cases 
	for regression Testing.
	>Regression Testing is Repitative in nature hence it should be
	done with Automation Testing.
	Selenium,QTP(UFT)-HP,  RFT-IBM
	
2.Testing Related to Function 
	>Checking Forms(with valid/ invalid data/ with optional /
	without optional field)
	>Checking Links(to identify broken or dead links)
	>Checking Cookies
		>Temp text file created by Server containing user 		information
		>Type:Sessional : Active till Browser is Open
		      Persistant : They have thier own Expiery Date
		>How to Test Cookie:
		1.Check content of Cookie is Encrypted or not
		2.Check cookie is active till session or till
		Expriry date(depending on type of Cookie)
		3.Disabling cookie should not allow important 
		function to work
		4.After Login if Cookies are cleared & some links 
		are click then Login Page should display

0	>>Smoke Testing(build verification Testing /Build Acceptance 
	Testing)
	>Decision Making point to accept build or not ?	
	What  ?: Checking Basic/Critical functionality of Build
	When  ?: Before Starting Actual / Detail Testing/System Testing
	Why  ?: 1.To Check Stability/testabilty 
		2.To avoid time wastage 

	Smoke Test & Actual Test

	>>Sanity Testing
	What  ?: Checking Basic/Critical functionality of Build
	When : After Defect fixing/ Add new requirement	 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.Testing Related to Non-Function
1.Performace Testing:
	>Checking Behaviour of System w.r.t Response Time
	Response Time: Time Difference between 1st bit of request
			& last bit of Response
	Latency	     : Time Difference between 1st bit of request
			& 1st bit of Response	
	Throughput   : Number of request processed per unit time

4.Testing Related to Structure
