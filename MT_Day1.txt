1.Requirement Gathering & Analysis
	BRS/FRS
	---
	Written in CLient Language & Hence anyone can understand
	Contains mostly functional Requirement
	Created by BA 
	
	SRS
	---
	Written using Technical Terms & Hence only tech. person can 	understand
	contains functional Requirement & Non functional Requirement
	Created by BA / Sr. BA / System Architech   

	Analysis:
