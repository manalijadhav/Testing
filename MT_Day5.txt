Defect Management:
------------------
A Process which need to be followed after Defect is Identified.
i.e Attriutes of Defect,flow of Defect,Tool to use, Status of
Defect.


Severity 				Priority
1.Impact of Defect from		1.Impact of Defect from
functionality P.O.V		Business/CLient P.O.V.

2.Decided by Quality Engineer	2.Decided by Dev/CLient/Business 
				Category person
3.Level				3.Level
High				High(Immediately,Urgent)
Defect in Basic/Critical Func.
Show stopper 
Abnormal Termination

Medium				Medium(Before Release)
Functional Defect but
Less Important

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Defect Flow:
-------------

1.Tester   > TTL   > DTL   > DEV > Tester     (Mostly in MNC)
2.Tester   > DTL/TTL  > DEV  > Tester    (Middle Scale Company )  
3.Tester   > DEV   > Tester  (Low Scale Company)

Defect Life Cycle:
-------------------




Test Planning :
---------------
A Process of Describing Strategy/ Approach of Testing is Called 
As Test Planning & Test Plan Document is Produced


Why to do  Test Planning ?
--------------------------
1.Better Management
2.Full utilization of Resources
3.Risk Management
4.to do effective Testing( Testing with Good Outcome)


When To Start Test Planing:
---------------------------
1.Requirement Document should be base line
2.Devlopment Plan should be Baseline



IEEE 829  :

1.Test Plan ID:
	LMS_MTP_01 >   MTP:Master Test Plan | STP:System Test Plan
	A COmpany Level Unique ID for Test PLan
	
2.References :
	1.SRS/BRS
	2.Devlopment Plan
	3.Previous version of Same Product(optional)
	4.Similar Project(optional)
	5.IEEE Research Paper (optional)

3.Introduction:
	4-5 lines about your Project

4.Feature to be Tested :(What to test ?)
	Admin: 
		> Add/Edit /Delete Books
		> Add/Edit /Delete User
		> Fine Calculate
		> Search for Books/User
		> Manage Profile
	
	Librarian:
		> Add/Edit /Delete Students
		> Issue  Book
		> Return Book
		> Fine Collection
		> Search for Book
		> Manage Profile
	Student:
		> Issue Book
		> Return Book
		> Pay Fine
		> Search Book
		> Request for Book

----------------------------------------------------------------------
5.Feature Not to be Tested:(What not to Test : Out of the Scope)
	1.Onlie Fine Payment( Will be Devlop in Next Version )
			
6.Test Items:
	Listing all Modules
	1.Admin
	2.Librarian
	3.Students

7.Test Environment/ Test Bed/ Test Lab:
Hardware & Software COnfiguration needed for Testing
	1.Software Requirement
		JDK,OS, Browser, MS-office, Webserver, Database etc.

	2.Hardware Requirement
		1.POS Machine
		2.Printer
		3.RAM
		4.Processor
8.Suspend & Resume (Temp Stop of Testing ) Criteria:
	1.Show Stopper Defect identified 
	2.Test Environment not Ready
	3.Number of Defect or Type of Defect is more 
	Where following on testing make no sense its 
	just waste of Testing
	

9.Entry Criteria(When To start Testing)  & Exit Criteria
	1.Source Code/SOftware should	   1.All Test Cases should be 	be Ready			   executed with 90% Quality	
	2.Environment should be ready	   2.No H.P Defect should be 	
	3.Test Cases should be ready	   Pending
					   3.Time & Budget is finished 

10.Test Delivarables()
	List Documents available During Testing
	1.Test Plan
	2.Test Sceanario
	3.Test Cases
	4.Test Scripts
	5.Execution Log
	6.Test Summary Reports
	7.Defect Report
11.Schedule:
	Deadlines of Activity
	Activity Name:				Days:
	--------------				-----
	1.Test Planning				2
	2.Test Analysis & Test Design		7
	3.Implementation			3
	4.Test Execution			2
	5.Evaluation Exit Criteria 		1

12.Roles & Responsibility
	Who is Incharge of Which Activity
	Activity Name:			Name:	  Designation
	--------------			-----
	1.Test Planning			Mr.John   Test Manager

	5.Evaluation Exit Criteria 	Mr.Malya  Sr. Quality Engineer

13.Staffing & Training
	>Hiring New Employee
	>Providing Training on Tool & Domain 
	for New or Old Employee
	
14.Test Approach(How to do Testing)
	1.Automation or Manual Testing
	2.Level of Testing
	3.Type of Testing  > Smoke , Usability, Performance Testing etc.
	4.Black or White Box Testing  > Black box Testing	

15.Risk & Contingecy(Project Risk/Process Risk)
	> Delay in Training
	> Delay in receiving Build
	> Manager not having Good Co-ordination Skill
		(Plan for  Leadership Training)
	> Less Time for Testing
		(Plan Daily Project Status tracking Process)
	> Supplier Issue
	> Test Environment Not ready on Time

16.Software Risk Issue:(Product Risk/Quality Risk):
	>Delivery of Incomplete Product
	>Delivery of faulty Product
	>Delivery of Product having security defect
	>Govt. policy change
	>HArd to use & Slow to respond
	
17.Approval:
	Name		Designation	Sign 	Date
	Jay K		Project Manager 	30/02/2070 

Test Strategy & Test Approach:
------------------------------
Test Strategy: 
-------------
>Its Static Document which is Common for all project
>Its having some common practices,Guidlines, protocol
types of Testing which is common for all project 

Test Approach:
-------------
>Implementation of Test Strategy to specific project
>i.e Implementation of Usability test is for COTS & custom 
software is different.

Test Estimation:
----------------
Its calculation of Time ,Cost & Human Resources

1.Metrix Based:
	Referring similar kind of Project  
2.Expert Based:
	Taking advice from Expert person
